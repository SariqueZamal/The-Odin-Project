    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups frozen peas and carrots</li>
      <li>2 cups frozen green beans</li>
      <li>1 cup sliced celery</li>
      <li>⅔ cup butter</li>
      <li>⅔ cup diced onion</li>
      <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon celery seed</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1 ¾ cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 ⅓ cups milk</li>
      <li>4 cups cubed leftover cooked turkey</li>
      <li>2 (14.1 ounce) packages pastry for a 9-inch double-crust pie</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place frozen peas, carrots, and beans in a saucepan with celery; add
        enough water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and
        simmer until celery is tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        While vegetables are simmering, melt butter in a saucepan over medium
        heat. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add flour,
        salt, pepper, celery seed, onion powder, and Italian seasoning and whisk
        until a paste forms, about 1 minute. Slowly whisk in chicken broth and
        then milk until incorporated; bring to a simmer and cook, whisking
        constantly, until sauce thickens, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove thickened sauce from the heat; add cooked, drained vegetables and
        cubed turkey and stir until filling is well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set out two 9-inch pie dishes. Fit one pie pastry into the bottom of
        each dish. Spoon 1/2 of the pot pie filling into each dish, then lay
        remaining pie pastries over top. Pinch and roll the top and bottom
        pastries together at the edges to seal. Use a sharp knife to cut several
        small slits in each top pastry to allow steam to escape while cooking.
        Place pies on baking sheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Check the top crusts for
        browning; if they are browning too quickly, cover with aluminum foil.
        Continue to bake until the crusts are golden brown and the filling is
        bubbly, 15 to 20 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Let pies cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
